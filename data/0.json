Pakistan and India.\nBefore the capture of Chamb by Pakistan forces, this western sector was under India's control","Similar to 1965, plans were made to capture this strategic town","The reason behind

no relation to the much-publicized Pakistani claims.According to Gen Beaufre, the Pakistani offensive in the Chhamb sector lacked boldness","Their forces moved slowly, and because of inadequate training and faulty planning, marrying of infantry and armour was delayed and resulted in a halt at the Manawar Wali Tawi, thus giving the Indians time to reinforce their position","Pakistan attacked positions west of the river with four battalions supported by one armoured regiment and five artillery regiments.\nArmour was not used in a concentrated manner, and artillery fire was spread all over instead of focusing on one objective at a time","Beaufre would have liked at least two brigades to attack simultaneously in the initial phase, followed by at least one brigade and a couple of armoured
