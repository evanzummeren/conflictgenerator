positions in ZNG-held territory and to secure arms and ammunition supplies for the poorly equipped ZNG.\nThe Battle of the Barracks was an escalation of the conflict between Croatian authorities and the Croatian Serbs who openly revolted in August 1990 and the JNA's efforts to preserve the Yugoslav federation","At the same time,  Croatia made moves towards achieving  independence from Yugoslavia","The Battle of the Barracks briefly preceded the start of the JNA's campaign in Croatia—itself amended in early September to add relief of the blockaded barracks to the operation plans","However, the JNA's advance was largely curbed by the ZNG and it relieved few JNA facilities.\nThe ZNG and the police captured small, isolated JNA posts, and a number of large weapons depots and barracks—including the entire 32nd (Varaždin) Corps of the JNA","The move provided the Croatian forces with a sizable stock of weapons—including 250 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces and a large

personally led this force into Basque Roads on the evening of 11 April.\nThe attack caused little direct damage, but in the narrow waters of the channel the fireships panicked the sailors of the

Gambier refused","Cochrane continued the battle over the next several days, successfully destroying several French ships, but with little support from Gambier","This allowed most of the French fleet to refloat and retreat up the Charente to safety","Gambier recalled Cochrane on 14 April and sent him back to Britain, withdrawing most of the inshore squadron at the same time, although scattered

shot.\nIn Britain the battle was celebrated as a victory, but many in the Navy were dissatisfied with Gambier's behaviour and Cochrane used his position as a Member of Parliament to publicly protest Gambier's leadership","Incensed, Gambier requested a court-martial to disprove Cochrane's accusations and the admiral's political allies ensured that the jury was composed of his supporters","After bitter and argumentative proceedings Gambier was exonerated of any culpability for failings during the battle","Cochrane's naval career was ruined, although the irrepressible officer remained a
