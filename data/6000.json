Kars was the last major operation of the Crimean War","In June 1855, attempting to alleviate pressure on the defence of Sevastopol, Emperor Alexander II ordered General Nikolay Muravyov to lead his troops against areas of Ottoman interest in Asia Minor","Uniting disparate contingents under his command into a strong corps of 25,725 soldiers, 96 light guns, Muravyov decided to attack Kars, the most important fortress of Eastern Anatolia.\nLate in 1854, British General William Fenwick Williams had been sent to Kars to assess the situation and report directly to Lord Raglan (FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan), the commander-in-chief of the British expeditionary forces in the Crimea","Williams found the city in a deplorable state","The Ottoman forces included many newly-conscripted

Williams","Muravyov's second assault pushed the Turks back, and he took the main road and the heights over the city, but the renewed vigour of the Ottoman troops took the Russians by surprise","The ferocious fighting that had ensued made them change tactics and start a siege that would last until late November","Upon hearing news of the attack, Ottoman Commander Omar Pasha asked for Ottoman troops to be moved from the line at the Siege of Sevastopol and redeployed to Asia Minor mainly with the idea of relieving Kars","After many delays, primarily put in place by Napoleon III, Omar Pasha left the Crimea for Sukhumi with 45,000 soldiers on 6 September.\nOmar Pasha's arrival on the Black Sea coast north of Kars induced Muravyov to begin a third assault on the Ottoman forces, which had been nearly starved","On 29 September, the Russians undertook a general attack on Kars, which lasted seven hours with extreme desperation, but they were repulsed","General Williams remained isolated, however, as Omar Pasha never reached the city","Instead of relieving the garrison he plunged into prolonged warfare in Mingrelia and took Sukhumi in the aftermath","In the meantime, the Ottoman reserves in Kars were running out, and the supply lines had been thinned.\nHeavy snowfall in late October made the Ottoman reinforcement of Kars quite impractical","Selim Pasha, Omar's son, landed another army at the ancient city of Trebizond, to the west, and began marching south to Erzerum to prevent the Russians from advancing further into Anatolia","The Russians sent a small force from the Kars lines to stop his advance and defeated the Ottomans at the River Ingur on 6 November.\nThe garrison of Kars declined to face further hardships of the winter siege and surrendered to General Muravyov on 28 November 1855, according to the Gregorian calendar","Muravyov was authorized by the tsar to change his name to \"Muravyov-Karsky\" to commemorate his part in taking the fortress","On entering the city the Russians \"were immediately horrified to discover masses of men too weak to be evacuated, many of them in the throes of death\"","Despite the lack of aid from Istanbul, Williams remained steadfast to his Ottoman troops and stated that \"they fell dead at their posts, in the tents, and throughout the camp, as brave men should who cling to their duty through the slightest

of Tel el Khuweilfe, which had been launched by General Edmund Allenby on 1 November, it eventually broke the Gaza-to-Beersheba line defended by the Yildirim Army Group","Despite having held this line since March 1917, the Ottoman Army was forced to evacuate Gaza and Tel el Khuweilfe during the night of 6–7 November","Only Sheria held out for most of the 7 November before it too was captured.Following British defeats at the First and Second battles of Gaza in March and April 1917, Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode commanding the EEF's Eastern Force and Kress von Kressenstein's Ottoman Empire force had each adopted a defensive posture and a stalemate had developed in Southern Palestine","Entrenched defences approximately on the lines held at the end of the second battle were strengthened, and both sides undertook regular mounted reconnaissances into the open eastern flank","In late June, Allenby replaced General Archibald Murray as commander of the EEF, which he quickly reorganised","At about the same time, the Ottoman Fourth Army was also restructured","As the stalemate continued in terrible conditions through the summer, reinforcements began to arrive to replace the large number of casualties suffered by the EEF during the previous fighting for Gaza, while several additional divisions also arrived","The Ottoman defenders were also reinforced at this time, and

British reinforcements arrived as Allenby's preparations to commence a campaign of manoeuvre neared completion.\nPrior to the Second Battle of Gaza, the town had been developed into a strong modern

Gaza eastwards to within 4 miles (6.4 km) of Beersheba","Beginning on 27 October, the EEF began a heavy and almost continuous bombardment of Gaza","During this time, the EEF's XXI Corps, holding the Gaza section of the line, had been mostly passive until the night of 1/2 November, when a series determined night-time assaults were mounted against the Gaza defences","Yet these attacks were only partially successful due to the strength of the garrison","The bombardment of Gaza intensified on 6 November and during the night of 6/7 November successful attacks were launched on several trench systems","On the morning of 7 November, Gaza was found to have been evacuated during the night","The Gaza to Beersheba line subsequently collapsed and the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies were forced

largely due to Manstein's strategy of controlled retreat towards the Dneiper","Freed on 2 February by the surrender of the German Sixth Army, the Red Army's Central Front turned its attention west and on 25 February expanded its offensive against both Army Group South and Army Group Center","Months of continuous operations had taken a heavy toll on the Soviet forces and some divisions were reduced to 1,000–2,000 combat effective soldiers","On 19 February, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein launched his Kharkov counterstrike, using the fresh II SS Panzer Corps and two panzer armies","Manstein benefited greatly from the massive air support of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen's Luftflotte 4, whose 1,214 aircraft flew over 1,000 sorties per day from 20 February to 15 March to support the German Army, a level of airpower equal to that during the Case Blue strategic offensive a year earlier.The Wehrmacht flanked, encircled, and defeated the Red Army's armored spearheads south of Kharkov","This enabled Manstein to renew his offensive against the city of Kharkov proper on 7 March","Despite orders to encircle Kharkov from the north, the SS Panzer Corps instead decided to
