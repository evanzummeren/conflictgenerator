the nature of the equipment that they possessed was not known","Some British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe","The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and, if possible, extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination.\nDue to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the installation from a seaborne raid, it was believed that a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the enemy to destroy the installation","It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.\nOn the night of 27 February, after a period of intense training and several delays due to poor weather, a company of airborne troops under the command of Major John Frost parachuted into France a few miles from the installation","The main force then

the complex","In July 1982, Harchand Singh Longowal, the President of the Sikh political party Akali Dal, had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence in the Golden Temple Complex to evade demolition of Sri Akal Takht Sahib","The government said that Bhindranwale later turned the sacred temple complex into an armoury and headquarters.Indian intelligence agencies had reported that three prominent heads of the Khalistan movement—Shabeg Singh — a court-martialed Indian Army officer who fought in major battles for India, Balbir Singh, and Amrik Singh, had made at least six trips each to Pakistan between 1981 and 1983","The weapons training was being provided at Akal Takht Sahib by General Shabeg Singh","The Intelligence Bureau alleged that the training was being provided at Gurdwaras in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh","Amrik Singh responded to these allegations by stating that student training camps with “traditional weapons” had existed prior for four decades at these locations"," The Soviet intelligence agency KGB reportedly tipped off the Indian intelligence agency R&AW about the CIA and ISI working together on a plan for Punjab","From its interrogation of a Pakistani army officer, R&AW received information that over a thousand trained Special Service Group commandos of the Pakistan Army had been dispatched by Pakistan into the Indian Punjab to assist Bhindranwale in his fight against the government, but there only common Sikhs could join Bhindranwale because of the high level of Indian Border Security","Many Pakistani agents also followed the smuggling routes in the Kashmir and Kutch region of Gujarat, with plans to commit sabotage.In 1981 the Soviets launched Operation Kontakt that was based on a forged document purporting to contain details of the weapons and money provided by the ISI to Sikh militants who wanted to create an independent country","In November 1982, Yuri Andropov, the General Secretary of the Communist Party and leader of the Soviet Union, approved a proposal to fabricate Pakistani intelligence documents detailing ISI plans to foment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan as an independent Sikh state","Indira Gandhi’s decision to move troops into the Punjab was based on her taking seriously the disinformation provided by the Soviets regarding secret CIA support for the Sikhs.On 1 June 1984, after negotiations with the militants failed, Indira Gandhi rejected the Anandpur Resolution and ordered the army to launch Operation Blue Star, simultaneously attacking scores of Sikh temples across Punjab","On 1 June Indian security forces commenced Operation Blue Star when they fired into various buildings with the goal of assessing the training of the militants, which resulted in the deaths of 8 civilians","A variety of army units and paramilitary forces surrounded the Golden Temple complex on 3 June 1984","The official stance of the army was that warnings were made to facilitate the evacuation of pilgrims but that no surrender or release occurred by June 5 at 7:00 PM","However, in April 2017 the Amritsar District and Sessions Judge Gurbir Singh gave a ruling which stated that there was no evidence that the Indian army provided warnings for pilgrims to leave the temple complex before commencing their assault","The army's assault on the temple complex ended on June 8","A clean-up operation codenamed Operation Woodrose was also initiated throughout Punjab.The army had underestimated the firepower possessed by the militants, whose armaments included Chinese-made rocket-propelled grenade launchers with armour-piercing capabilities","Tanks and heavy artillery were used to attack the militants, who responded with anti-tank and machine-gun fire from the heavily fortified Akal Takht","After a 24-hour firefight, the army gained control of the temple complex","The official casualty figures for the army were 83 dead and 249 injured; however, Rajiv Gandhi disclosed in September of 1984 that 700 soldiers were killed","The government-issued white paper stated that 1,592 militants were apprehended and there were 493 combined militant and civilian casualties","According to the government, high civilian casualties were attributed to militants using pilgrims trapped inside the temple as human shields","However, the Indian army had allowed thousands of pilgrims and protestors to enter the temple complex on 3 June 1984 and prevented them from leaving after imposing a curfew at 10:00 PM on the same day","Eyewitnesses alleged that on 6 June after the fighting had stopped the Indian military executed detainees who had their arms tied behind their backs, and fired on men and women who had heeded the announcements of the military to evacuate.The military action in the temple complex was criticized by Sikhs worldwide, who interpreted it as an assault on the Sikh religion","Many Sikh soldiers in the army deserted their units, several Sikhs resigned from civil administrative office and returned awards received from the Indian government","Five months after the operation, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in an act of revenge by her two Sikh bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh","Public outcry over Gandhi's death led to the killings of more than 3,000 Sikhs in Delhi alone, in the ensuing 1984

was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year's Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.Secrecy for the operation was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of the operation and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire","British signals intelligence (Ultra) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was imminent.\nThe operation achieved some surprise and tactical success, but was ultimately a failure","A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground but replaced within a week","Allied aircrew casualties were quite small, since the majority of Allied losses were grounded aircraft","The Germans, however, lost many pilots who could not be readily replaced.Post-battle analysis suggests only 11 of the Luftwaffe's 34 air combat Gruppen (groups) made attacks on time and with surprise","The operation failed to

and canals","An attack on the city's harbour was thus deemed necessary by Allied command, although the risk of damage to the city's architectural and artistic treasures was high, as it had been in other battles of the Italian campaign, such as Battle of Monte Cassino","The operation was planned to be extremely precise to avoid any such damage and was named Operation Bowler by Air Vice-Marshal Robert Foster, as a reminder to those involved that they would be \"bowler hatted\" (returned to civilian life) or worse should Venice itself be damaged.\nHaving assessed the weather, Westlake led the

Brevity was a limited offensive conducted in mid-May 1941, during the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War","Conceived by the commander-in-chief of the British Middle East Command, General Archibald Wavell, Brevity was intended to be a rapid blow against weak Axis front-line forces in the Sollum–Capuzzo–Bardia area of the border between Egypt and Libya","Although the operation got off to a promising start, throwing the Axis high command into confusion, most of its early gains were lost to local counter-attacks, and with German reinforcements being rushed to the front the operation was called off after one day.\nEgypt had been invaded by Libyan-based Italian forces in September 1940, but by February of the following year a British counter-offensive had advanced well into Libya, destroying the Italian Tenth Army in the process","British attention then shifted to Greece, which was under the threat of Axis invasion","While Allied divisions were being diverted from North Africa, the Italians reinforced their positions and were supported by the arrival of the German Afrika Korps under Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel","Rapidly taking the offensive against his distracted and over-stretched opponent, by April 1941 Rommel had driven the British and Commonwealth forces in Cyrenaica back across the Egyptian border","Although the battlefront now lay in the border area, the port city of Tobruk—100 miles (160 km) inside Libya—had resisted the Axis advance, and its substantial Australian and British garrison constituted a significant threat to Rommel's lengthy supply chain","He therefore committed his main strength to besieging the city, leaving the front line only thinly held.\nWavell defined Operation Brevity's main objectives as the acquisition of territory from which to launch a further planned offensive toward Tobruk, and the depletion of German and Italian forces in the region","With limited battle-ready units to draw on in the wake of Rommel's recent successes, on 15 May Brigadier William Gott attacked  in three columns with a mixed infantry and armoured force","The strategically important Halfaya Pass was taken against stiff Italian opposition, and deeper inside Libya Fort Capuzzo was captured, but German counter-attacks under Colonel Maximilian von Herff regained the fort during the afternoon causing heavy casualties amongst its defenders","Gott—concerned that his forces were in danger of being caught by German armour in open ground—conducted a staged withdrawal to the Halfaya Pass on 16 May, and Brevity was closed down","The importance of the Halfaya Pass as a safe supply route was highlighted to Rommel, and 11 days later it was recaptured during Operation Skorpion, a German counter-attack."]},{"title":"Operation Brevity

During the night of 16 February the Viet Cong attacked a South Vietnamese Regional Force compound at Lang Phuoc Hai, before withdrawing the following morning after heavy fighting with South Vietnamese forces","Two hours later, a Viet Cong company was reported to have formed a tight perimeter in the rainforest 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of Lang Phuoc Hai, near the abandoned hamlet of Ap My An","In response, the Australians deployed a quick reaction force","Anticipating that the Viet Cong would attempt to withdraw, as they had during previous encounters, forces from the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) were inserted to block the likely withdrawal route in the hope of intercepting and destroying them.\nOn the afternoon of 17 February, American UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) deployed 6 RAR into the area north-west of Hoi My","Following an airmobile assault into an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, A Company 6 RAR was surprised by a strong, well-sited and dug-in Viet Cong force — which, rather than withdrawing, had likely remained in location in an attempt to ambush any reaction force sent to the area","The Australians were soon contacted by heavy small arms fire, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys","A Company subsequently broke contact and withdrew under heavy fire from what appeared to be a Viet Cong base area","Initially believing they were opposed by only a company, 6 RAR subsequently launched a quick attack by two companies","However, unknown to the Australians, the Viet Cong had been reinforced and they now faced a battalion-sized force in well prepared positions.\nAt 15:35, supported by air strikes, armour, and fire from A Company, B Company assaulted the position","From the outset, lead elements came under constant Viet Cong sniper fire from the trees, and from previously undetected machine-guns","The assault soon faltered, with steadily increasing casualties as the Viet Cong withstood multiple frontal assaults, including bayonet charges by two separate platoons","Surrounded and receiving fire from all sides, the lead Australian elements from B Company could advance no further against the determined dug-in force; all attempts to regain momentum failed to dislodge the defenders","Initially, the Australians used their APCs to secure the landing zone at the jungle's edge, but when the infantry was in trouble they were dispatched as a relief force","Fighting their way forward, the M113s finally arrived by 18:15 and began loading the most seriously wounded as darkness approached","The Viet Cong subsequently launched two successive counter-attacks, both repulsed by the Australians","During the fighting, one of the APCs was disabled by a recoilless rifle at close range, killing the driver.\n\nBy 19:00, after a five-hour battle, B Company broke contact and withdrew into a night harbour near the landing zone with the remainder of the battalion","Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered their withdrawal, then pounded the battlefield into the evening","After a tense night, the Australians returned in the morning to find the Viet Cong had left the area, dragging most of their dead and wounded with them while avoiding a large blocking force","A hard-fought affair at close range, the disciplined Viet Cong force matched the Australians as both sides stood their ground, inflicting heavy casualties on each other, before each fell back","Although 6 RAR ultimately prevailed, the vicious fighting at Ap My An was probably the closest the

heard from British and Gibraltar authorities that the IRA team had been tracked to Málaga Airport, where they were lost by the Spanish police, and that the three did not re-emerge until Savage was sighted parking his car in Gibraltar","The soldiers each testified that they had opened fire in the belief that the suspected bombers were reaching for weapons or a remote detonator","Among the civilians who gave evidence were the eyewitnesses discovered by \"Death on the Rock\", who gave accounts of seeing the three shot without warning, with their hands up, or while they were on the ground","Kenneth Asquez, who told the documentary that he had seen a soldier fire at Savage repeatedly while the latter was on the ground, retracted his statement at the inquest, claiming that he had been pressured into giving it","On 30 September, the inquest jury returned a verdict of \"lawful killing\"","Dissatisfied, the families took the case to the European Court of Human Rights","Delivering its judgement in 1995, the court found that the operation had been in violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights as the authorities' failure to arrest the suspects at the

the site and did not cooperate fully with the IAEA","The international silence may have been a tacit recognition of the inevitability of preemptive attacks on \"clandestine nuclear programs in their early stages.\" If true, the Begin Doctrine has undoubtedly played a role in shaping this global perception.According to official government confirmation on 21 March 2018, the raid was carried out by

the site the day before so that they could highlight the target with laser designators, while a later report identified Sayeret Matkal special-forces commandos as involved.The attack pioneered the use of Israel's electronic warfare capabilities, as IAF electronic warfare (EW) systems took over Syria's air defense systems, feeding them a false sky-picture for the entire period of time that the

African Campaign (1940–1943)","From 1940 to 1942, the Axis conducted the Siege of Malta, with air and naval forces","Despite many losses, enough supplies were delivered by the British for the population and military forces on Malta to resist, although it ceased to be an offensive base for much of 1942","The most crucial supply item in Operation Pedestal was fuel, carried by SS Ohio, an American tanker with a British crew","The convoy sailed from Britain on 3 August 1942 and passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean on the night of 9/10 August.The Axis attempt to prevent the fifty ships of the convoy reaching Malta using bombers, German E-boats, Italian MAS and MS boats, minefields and submarine ambushes, was the last sizeable Axis success in the Mediterranean","More than 500 Merchant and Royal Navy sailors and airmen were killed and only five of the 14 merchant ships reached Grand Harbour","While costly for the Allies, it was a strategic victory; the arrival of Ohio justified the decision to hazard so many warships; its cargo of aviation fuel revitalised the Maltese air offensive against Axis shipping","Submarines returned to Malta and Supermarine Spitfires flown from the aircraft carrier HMS Furious enabled a maximum effort to be made against Axis ships","Italian convoys had to detour further away from the island, lengthening the journey and increasing the time during which air and naval attacks could be mounted","The Siege of Malta was broken by the Allied re-conquest of Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 11 November) and by Operation Torch (8–16 November) in the western Mediterranean, which enabled land-based aircraft to escort merchant ships to the island."]},{"title":"Operation

begin immediately after the British beach landings with an advance to the south-east of Caen by XXX Corps","Three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands and the operation was amended","The operation was expanded to include I Corps for a pincer attack on Caen.\nOn the next day, XXX Corps in the west pushed south to Tilly-sur-Seulles, which was occupied by the Panzer-Lehr Division and the village was captured and re-captured several times","I Corps began the eastern thrust two days later from the Orne bridgehead, which had been secured in Operation Tonga on D-Day","I Corps was also delayed by constant counter-attacks of the 21st Panzer Division","With mounting casualties and no sign of a German collapse, the offensive east of Caen was suspended on 13 June.\nFurther west in the US First Army area, American attacks forced a gap in the German defences","Part of the British 7th Armoured Division was diverted from Tilly-sur-Seulles, to advance through the gap in a  flanking manoeuvre and force the Panzer Lehr Division to fall back, to avoid encirclement","On 14 June, after two days of battle including the Battle of Villers-Bocage, the 7th Armoured Division was ordered to withdraw towards Caumont","Plans were made to resume the offensive once the 7th Armoured Division had been reinforced but the plans came to nothing when a storm in the English Channel seriously delayed the landing of supplies and reinforcements.\nThe battle is controversial because many historians and writers have concluded that it was failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success","To resist the offensive, the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured

break down as had been predicted and the brigade failed to prevent Axis flanking moves in the desert, south of the Cyrenaican bulge, which left Australian infantry in Benghazi no option but to retreat up the Via Balbia","Rommel split his forces into small columns to harry the British retreat as far as the Axis fuel and water shortage permitted","A considerable British force was captured at Mechili, which led to the British retreat continuing to Tobruk and then to the Libyan–Egyptian frontier","Axis forces failed to capture Tobruk in the first rush and Rommel then had to divide the Axis forces between Tobruk and the frontier.\nSonnenblume succeeded because the ability of the Germans to mount an offensive was underestimated by General Archbald Wavell, the Commander in Chief Middle East, the

Southeast Croatia, a follow-up operation known as Operation Ozren was carried out between the Bosna and Spreča rivers","Both operations also involved Croatian Home Guard and Italian troops and are associated with what is known as the Second Enemy Offensive (Serbo-Croatian Latin: Druga neprijateljska ofenziva) in post-war Yugoslav historiography","The Second Enemy Offensive forms part of the Seven Enemy Offensives framework in Yugoslav historiography.\nThe insurgents in the area of operations included some groups of the communist-led Partisans and some of Serb–chauvinist Chetniks","Although the Partisans and Chetniks had already irrevocably split in the German-occupied territory of Serbia following Operation Uzice in late 1941, this had not yet happened in eastern Bosnia, and in some areas they were still cooperating","As a result, differentiating between the rank and file of the two groups was difficult, as even the communist-led insurgent groups consisted mainly of Serb peasants who had little understanding of the political aims of their leaders","While there were 20,000 Chetnik insurgents located within the area of operations, they offered no resistance to the German–NDH forces and many withdrew east across the Drina river to avoid being engaged","This contributed to the complete unravelling of Chetnik–Partisan cooperation in eastern Bosnia","The Partisan main force was able to evade the Germans, infiltrate through the Italian cordon to the south and establish itself around Foča.\nThe failure of the Axis forces to decisively engage the Partisans during these operations necessitated a further major offensive, Operation Trio, in the area immediately south of where Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren had taken

undertaken by the forces of the SAO Krajina, an unrecognized Croatian Serb region opposing the Republic of Croatia, against positions held by the Croatian police in the region of Banovina on 26–27 July 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence","It was primarily aimed at police stations in Glina and Kozibrod, as well as police-held positions in a string of villages between the town of Dvor and Kozibrod","In addition to Glina and Kozibrod, heavy fighting took place in the village of Struga, north of Dvor, where Croatian Serb forces employed a human shield consisting of Croat civilians taken from their homes in Struga and the nearby village of Zamlača","\nThe Croatian Serb rebels captured the police station in Glina, but were stopped in Struga before the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) arrived there to create a buffer zone and, according to the JNA, assist the Croatian police to evacuate","On 29 July, as the non-Serb civilian population left Kozibrod and the villages to the south of it, the police station in Kozibrod was evacuated as well","The fighting resulted the bulk of the region being transferred to Croatian Serb and JNA control.\nIn the aftermath of the fighting, a number of Croatian Serb troops threatened the regional commander in Dvor, blaming him for the deaths of members of their unit in the fighting","Afterwards, they killed several Croat civilians who were undergoing treatment at the Dvor medical centre","Croatian authorities filed war crime charges against Dragan Vasiljković, specifically for leading the attack in Glina which resulted in civilian deaths, as well as injuring and killing prisoners of war","Vasiljković was arrested in Australia in 2006, and as of January 2015 he is awaiting extradition to Croatia."]},{"title":"Operation Storm","sentences":["Operation Storm (Serbo-Croatian: Operacija Oluja / Операција Олуја) was the last major battle of the Croatian War of Independence and a major factor in the outcome of the Bosnian War","It was a decisive victory for the Croatian Army (HV), which attacked across a 630-kilometre (390 mi) front against the self-declared proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and a strategic victory for the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH)","The HV was supported by the Croatian special police advancing from the Velebit Mountain, and the ARBiH located in the Bihać pocket, in the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina's (ARSK) rear","The battle, launched to restore Croatian control of 10,400 square kilometres (4,000 square miles) of territory, representing 18.4% of the territory it claimed, and Bosnian control of Western Bosnia, was the largest European land battle since the Second World War","Operation Storm commenced at dawn on 4 August 1995 and was declared complete on the evening of 7 August, despite significant mopping-up operations against pockets of resistance lasting until 14 August.\nOperation Storm was a strategic victory in the Bosnian War, effectively ending the siege of Bihać and placing the HV, Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the ARBiH in a position to change the military balance of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the subsequent Operation Mistral 2","The operation built on HV and HVO advances made during Operation Summer '95, when strategic positions allowing the rapid capture of the RSK capital Knin were gained, and on the continued arming and training of the HV since the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, when the RSK was created during the Serb Log Revolution and Yugoslav People's Army intervention","The operation itself followed an unsuccessful United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission and diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict.\nThe HV's and ARBiH's strategic success was a result of a series of improvements to the armies themselves, and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH","The attack was not immediately successful at all points, but seizing key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability","The HV capture of Bosansko Grahovo, just before the operation, and the special police's advance to Gračac, made it nearly impossible to defend Knin","In Lika, two guard brigades quickly cut the ARSK-held area which lacked tactical depth and mobile reserve forces, and they isolated pockets of resistance, positioned a mobile force for a decisive northward thrust into the Karlovac Corps area of responsibility (AOR), and pushed ARSK towards Banovina","The defeat of the ARSK at Glina and Petrinja, after a tough defensive, defeated the ARSK Banija Corps as well since its reserve was pinned down by the ARBiH","The RSK relied on the Republika Srpska and Yugoslav militaries as its strategic reserve, but they did not intervene in the battle","The United States also played a role in the operation by directing Croatia to a military consultancy firm, Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI), that signed a Pentagon licensed contract to advise, train and provide intelligence to the Croatian army.\nThe HV and the special police suffered 174–211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed","Four UN peacekeepers were also killed","The HV captured 4,000 prisoners of war","The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputed—Croatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing","During and after the offensive, around 150,000–200,000 Serbs of the area formerly held by the ARSK had fled and a variety of crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there by Croatian forces","The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later tried three Croatian generals charged with war crimes and partaking in a joint criminal enterprise designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia, although all three were ultimately acquitted and the tribunal refuted charges of a criminal enterprise","The ICTY concluded that Operation Storm was not aimed at ethnic persecution, as civilians had not been deliberately targeted","The ICTY stated that Croatian Army and Special Police committed a large number of crimes against the Serb population after the artillery assault, but that the state and military leadership was not responsible for their creation and organizing","Croatia also adopted discriminatory measures to prevent the return of Serbs","Human Rights Watch reported that the vast majority of the abuses during the operation were committed by Croatian forces and that the abuses continued on a large scale for months afterward, which included executions of civilians and destruction of Serb property","The Croatian population had been years prior subjected to ethnic cleansing in the areas held by ARSK by rebel Serb forces, with an estimated 170,000–250,000 expelled and numerous killings","In 2010, Serbia sued Croatia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that the offensive constituted a genocide","In 2015, the court ruled that the offensive was not genocidal and that although the Serb population fled as a result, Croatia did not have the specific intent of displacing the country's Serb minority and that ethnic cleansing or civilian targeting did not occur","However, it was found that crimes against civilians had been committed by Croatian forces","As of November 2012, the Croatian judiciary has convicted 2,380 persons for various crimes committed during Operation

consequently intercepting the Knin—Drvar road—a critical supply route of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK)","The operation failed to achieve its declared primary goal of drawing VRS

resumption of attacks by the VRS and the RSK military on the Bihać pocket—one of six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina","The area was viewed as strategic to the Croatian

two-mile approach up to the coast, which was heavily guarded","His expedition found that in the water near the coast, the Germans had equipped Teller mines on stakes"," When the tide was in, the mines would be underwater, and landing craft would be unable to see them at high tide and especially at night, and thus would strike them","However, the setup did not account for the fact that the mines were not waterproof and thus had corroded"," \nBecause of the corrosion, the mines only detonated because of the rockets from the RAF fighter, which had fallen short","Lane's conclusion was that the deployment was only a hasty improvisation, and did not represent an advance in the Germans' mine technology.Four of the missions were commanded by Captain Hilton-Jones, based in Dover","Major Ernest

understanding of the political aims of their leaders.\nOperation Trio consisted of two parts, Trio I and Trio II","Together they comprised one element of the Axis effort known as the Third Enemy Offensive (Serbo-Croatian Latin: Treća neprijateljska ofenziva) in post-war Yugoslav historiography","The joint Italian-Chetnik offensive in Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina formed the other element","The Third Enemy Offensive forms part of the Seven Enemy Offensives framework in Yugoslav historiography.\nThe operation was of limited effectiveness due to several factors, including preemptive action by the Ustaše militia and Italian delays","The area of operations straddled the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of occupation within the NDH, which led to mutual suspicion and lack of coordination","Both insurgent factions avoided fighting the Axis and NDH forces, instead focusing on fighting each other","After Operation Trio, the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito, his Supreme Headquarters and the Partisan main force, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades, withdrew from their base of operations around Foča","After briefly reorganising around Zelengora mountain south-east of Foča, they moved their operations to western Bosnia for the remainder of 1942.\nOperation Trio coincided with and contributed to the polarisation of the almost exclusively Serb rebels in eastern Bosnia into two groups: the Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and the multi-ethnic and communist-led Partisans","Encouraged by Chetnik propaganda against Croats and Bosnian Muslims and repelled by the sectarian left-wing policies and actions of the communists, many Serb peasant fighters were swayed to the Chetnik cause","Violent coups occurred against the communist leadership of all but one of the Partisan detachments in eastern Bosnia, and these detachments effectively defected to the Chetniks","Most of the surviving communist fighters from these detachments rejoined the Partisan forces, and many withdrew with Tito to western Bosnia during the Partisan Long March","Within a few weeks of the end of Operation Trio only 600 Partisan fighters were left in eastern Bosnia, comprising the Group of Shock Battalions and the Birač Partisan Detachment","All these forces sought refuge in the Birač region","The Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia, at best a confederacy of local warlords, was strengthened by mass defections from the Partisans","For a time they ruled large parts of the region, after making accommodations with the Ustaše regime in May and June 1942."]},{"title":"Operation Tungsten","sentences":["Operation Tungsten was a Second World War Royal Navy air raid that targeted the German battleship Tirpitz","The operation sought to damage or

by fears that the battleship, upon re-entering service, would attack strategically important convoys carrying supplies to the Soviet Union","Removing the threat posed by Tirpitz would also allow the Allies to redeploy the capital ships which had to be held in the North Sea to counter her","After four months of training and preparations, the British Home Fleet sailed on 30 March 1944 and aircraft launched from five aircraft carriers struck Kaafjord on 3 April","The raid achieved surprise, and the British aircraft met little opposition","Fifteen bombs hit the battleship, and strafing by fighter aircraft inflicted heavy casualties on her gun crews","Four British aircraft and nine airmen were lost during the operation.\nThe damage inflicted during the attack was not sufficient to sink or disable Tirpitz, but she suffered considerable damage to her superstructure and unarmored areas, with 122 members of her crew killed and 316 were wounded","The German Kriegsmarine decided to repair the battleship, and works were completed by mid-July","The British conducted further carrier raids against Tirpitz between April and August 1944 in the hope of prolonging the period she was out of

aimed at destroying German forces in and around Stalingrad","Planning for Operation Uranus had commenced in September 1942, and was developed simultaneously with plans to envelop and destroy German Army Group Center (Operation Mars) and German forces in the Caucasus","The Red Army took advantage of the German army's poor preparation for winter, and the fact that its forces in the southern Soviet Union were overstretched near Stalingrad, using weaker Romanian troops to guard their flanks; the offensives' starting points were established along the section of the front directly opposite Romanian forces","These Axis armies lacked heavy equipment to deal with Soviet armor.\nDue to the length of the front created by the German summer offensive, aimed at taking the Caucasus oil fields and the

was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise.\nOn 12 May 1942, Soviet forces under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive","After a promising start, the offensive was stopped on 15 May by massive airstrikes","Critical Soviet errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly raised forces, facilitated a German pincer attack on 17 May which cut off three Soviet field armies from the rest of the front by 22 May","Hemmed into a narrow area, the 250,000-strong Soviet force inside the pocket

known as the Battle of Ács, took place at 2 July 1849, between the Hungarian army led by General Artúr Görgei and the imperial army of Austria led by Field Marshal Julius von Haynau, which had also an almost 12 000 strong Russian contingent led by Lieutenant General Fyodor Sergeyevich Panyutyin.\nThe imperial army outnumbered the Hungarian troops by 2 to 1, was superior also regarding the multitude of infantry (landwehr, grenadiers, seressaner, kaiserjägers) and light (uhlans, dragoons, cossacks, chevau-léger) as well as heavy (cuirassiers) cavalry  unit types (while the Hungarians except the landwehr, called in Hungarian Honvéd, and the hussars, had numerically very few other kinds of units), and the quality of the weapons","Except the problems of military kind, problems of other kind also influenced negatively the Hungarian army","Short before the battle, the conflict between the Hungarian commander, Görgei, and the political leadership of Hungary, Lajos Kossuth and the Szemere-Government, escalated abruptly","The government lead by Kossuth, decided to retreat the Hungarian troops from the perfectly defensible Komárom to Southern Hungary, leaving half of the country in the hands of the enemy, without consulting the war minister Görgei, who was the only person with the right to take a military decision","Görgei considered this illegal decision as very wrong, but he accepted to execute it, in order to avoid the confrontation with the political leadership in such a critical military situation, fixing the date of the depart towards southern Hungary to 3 July","But despite of this, on 31 June Kossuth laid off Görgei from the high command of the Hungarian army, because he had read two of the latters letters in the wrong order","All these caused uncertainty and conflicts among the Hungarian officers and also soldiers before this very important enemy attack","Kossuth even sent Lieutenant General Lázár Mészáros to Komárom, to take the leadership from Görgei, and send him to Pest","But when Mészáros approached on 2 July, on a steam boat, to Komárom, he heard the gunshots of the battle, and returned to Pest.\nThe Austrian Supreme Commander Field Marshal Julius Jacob von Haynau's plan was to force the Hungarian troops to retreat in the fortress of Komárom, to lay, with a part of his army, a siege against it from the south, opening in this way the road towards Buda and Pest","After accomplishing this goal the bulk of Haynau's troops had to advance towards East, and occupy the Hungarian capitals, before his allies, the Russian main troops led by Ivan Paskevich, arrived there","\nThe battle started on the early morning of 2 July with the attack of the I corps led by General Franz Schlik of the imperial troops from the direction of Ács, chasing quickly away the Hungarians from the Ács forest, then pushing them into the fortifications lying South from Komárom, and even capturing the Monostor-trenches, thus entering in the fortifications, menacing to occupy the whole southern fortification and trench system of the fortress, putting in danger the Hungarian troops from there, to be completely encircled","\nArtúr Görgei was not expecting a major enemy attack in that day, and, foreseeing that he will be dismissed from the military leadership, and knowing the animosity of the political class against him, in that night and early morning, right when the enemy attack started, he was writing a letter in which he explained the causes of his military decisions, accusing Kossuth for the military and political problems","He stopped the writing when he heard the sound of the gunshots of the battle, and rushed to the battlefield","He arrived on the battlefield, and faced the disastrous situation, in which the Hungarian VIII corps was fleeing from the battlefield, letting the Western external trenches of the fortress and some of the fortifications in the hands of the Austrians","The Hungarian main commander, after trying in vain to convince them to fight the advancing Austrians, stopped the rout of the Hungarian soldiers of the VIII corps by commanding grapeshots and volley fire against them, managing with this extreme method to stop them, then ordering them to regroup, and with the support of the VII and II corps, to chase away Schlik's troops from the fortifications, as well as from the Ács forest","The Hungarian counter attack, supported from South (the Herkály waste) by the Hungarian cavalry of the VII corps, led by General Ernő Poeltenberg, put in danger the Austrian left flank commanded by General Franz Schlik to be cut from the rest of the imperial army, but the latter was saved by the involvement in the fights of the Russian division led by Lieutenant General Fyodor Panyutyin and the Austrian Simbschen-brigade of the I","corps, which forced Poeltenberg to retreat, in order to escape the encirclement, thus stopping the Hungarian advancement.\nDuring these fights on the imperial troops left flank, on the right flank, the Austrian brigade of the IV (reserve) corps, led by General Lajos Benedek occupied Ószőny, which opened the way of the imperials towards Buda and Pest","General György Klapka, the commander of the Hungarian III corps, ordered several counter attacks to reoccupy this crucial locality, but despite some initial successes, his troops were forced to retreat.\nDuring these events Haynau was totally unaware of the situation on the battlefield, and thought that his troops had already won the battle, ordering his center (the IV corps) to retreat from the battlefield, thus putting his army in danger to be destroyed by a Hungarian attack, by cutting his lines in two","Görgei noticed the opportunity, and tried to concentrate his cavalry in the middle, massing also important artillery units there","Luckily for Haynau, his brigade commanders (Simbschen, Ludwig, Lederer), as well as Panyutyin, understood the danger and intervened with their troops, closing the gap from their forefront.\nGörgei understood how crucial is to retake Ószőny from the enemy, so he decided to force them to send reinforcements from the flanks towards the centre, by commanding an attack with the concentrated cavalry and artillery of the Hungarian army under his control in the middle","Klapka also sent the cavalry of the III corps in the middle to help Görgei, hoping that this will force Benedek to weaken his troops from Ószőny, sending reinforcements to the centre","The Hungarian hussar charge was commanded personally by Görgei and Poeltenberg, putting to flight many units of the enemy cavalry","The Hungarian artillery, which followed the cavalry, started a cannonade which hit the Austrian headquarters from Csém where the emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was observing the battle, forcing him and the main commander Haynau to retreat with the headquarters to Bana","\nThe Hungarian cavalry attack, in which participated around 24 hussar companies (3000 riders), being the biggest Hungarian cavalry charge of the entire war, reached its goal, and forced General Benedek, to send reinforcements towards the center, which enabled Klapka, to recapture Ószőny, from where the Austrians retreated in haste","\nThe cavalry attack continued, when Görgei, who was leading the hussars, was hit in the head by a shell splinter shot by an enemy cannon, causing him a very heavy injury","Despite of this he remained sane - trying to send orders to his troops while his head was massively bleeding - until the end of the battle, when he finally fainted, remaining after that, unconscious for several days, being in the meanwhile operated a couple of times","\nIn the end, thanks to the reinforcements sent from the flanks, the enemy cavalries and artillery massed in front of the Hungarian hussars, forming an important superiority, which finally pushed back the Hungarian cavalry, then both armies retreated from the battlefield.\nThe battle ended around 8 pm","\nThe result can be considered a Hungarian victory, because Haynau's plans to close the Hungarian troops in Komárom, enabling to his army to occupy the Hungarian capitals, failed, and his troops were forced to retreat from every strategic position occupied during the battle","The total defeat of the imperial army was prevented not by Haynau, but by his subalterns, who recognised the danger created by their high commanders wrong decision to retreat his troops from the middle, and filled the gap, before the Hungarian cavalry arrived there.\nThe day after the battle the Hungarian generals learned about the deposition of Görgei from the high commandement by Kossuth, and protested against this decision, forcing him to let Görgei to continue to lead the Army of the Upper Danube","After 11 July Görgei was again in charge of the army, fighting successfully his way through Northern Hungary towards East against the 5 times bigger Russian army led by Ivan Paskevich."]},{"title":"Second Battle of Krithia","sentences":["The Second Battle of Krithia continued the Allies' attempts to advance on the Helles battlefield during the Battle of
