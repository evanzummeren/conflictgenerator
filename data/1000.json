and its South African allies defeated a major FAPLA offensive towards Mavinga, preserving the former's control of southern Angola","They proceeded to launch a bloody but inconclusive counteroffensive on FAPLA defensive positions around the Tumpo River east of Cuito Cuanavale.\nFollowing a number of failed attempts to take the settlements in 1986, eight FAPLA brigades mustered for a final offensive—Operação Saludando Octubre—in August 1987 with extensive auxiliary support from one of Angola's closest military allies, the Soviet Union","The FAPLA offensive took the form of a two-pronged, multi-divisional movement southwards towards Mavinga, a major UNITA stronghold and logistics centre","Once Mavinga was in its hands, FAPLA intended to expel the remaining insurgents from Moxico Province and pave the way for a final assault on the UNITA headquarters at Jamba","The Soviet Union supplied FAPLA with over a billion dollars' worth of new military hardware for the purpose of this offensive, and between 4 and 9 Soviet advisers were attached to each FAPLA unit on the brigade level.South Africa, which shared a common border with Angola through the contested territory of South West Africa (Namibia), was then determined to prevent FAPLA from gaining control of Mavinga and allowing insurgents of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) to operate in the

disperse, effectively ending the rising.Culloden and its aftermath continue to arouse strong feelings","The University of Glasgow awarded the Duke of Cumberland an honorary doctorate, but many modern

his rival from Tigray, Dejazmach Sabagadis of Agame","Although Ras Marye lost his life in this battle, Dejazmach Sabagadis was defeated, and after surrendering was executed by Ras Marye's Oromo followers","\nRas Marye had inherited the mantle of Regent of the Emperor of Ethiopia, and while admittedly a Christian, his Oromo ancestry caused much resentment from the other Christian aristocrats and nobles of Ethiopia","Dejazmach Sabagadis attempted to exploit this antipathy, and succeeded in forming a coalition with his fellow Christian lords of Gojjam, Lasta and Semien against Ras Marye.\nForewarned of this plot, Ras Marye struck first and defeated the members of this coalition individually","After defeating Dejazmach Goshu in Gojjam, Ras Marye turned north and marched into Semien and attacked Dejazmach Wube Haile Maryam; Sabagadis failed to come to the help of his ally, and Wube decided to submit to the Ras than face him alone","Having isolated Sebagadis, Ras Marye now crossed the Tekezé River against his rival, supported not only by Oromo contingents from Wollo, Yejju, Begemder and Amhara but also by the armies of Dejazmaches Wube and Goshu.\nThe opposing armies met on 14 February 1831 at Mai Islami near Debre Abbay (which is why this battle is also sometimes called the Battle of Mai Islami)","Although Sabagadis had the superiority of a far larger number of firearms, his matchlockmen were poorly employed and failed to overcome the vaunted Oromo cavalry"," The battle resulted in immense casualties, one of whom was Ras Marye","Defeated, the Dejazmach sought to escape the vengeance of Ras Marye's kinsmen by surrendering to his former ally Wube; Wube handed the Dejazmach over to his victorious allies, and the Oromo executed Sebagadis.The Oromo

overthrow Ras Ali II as Regent of the Emperor of Ethiopia and gain control of Ethiopia","This confused battle was won by Ras Ali, but at a steep price, and this victory failed to cement his position as the most powerful nobleman of his time.\nDejazmach Wube's strategy against Ras Ali depended on his ability to import more firearms, which would provide him with a tactical superiority that would more than outweigh the vaunted cavalry of Ras Ali's Oromo kinsmen, and to obtain an Abuna for the Ethiopian Church, who would help unite the demoralized Christian population behind him","Wube made several appeals to obtain firearms from European governments, but did not succeed in obtaining any until the middle of 1841 when Theophile Lefebvre returned from France with a small quantity of weapons and a number of artisans who immediately began to repair a cannon Wube had obtained from Ras Wolde Selassie and manufacture war materials","About the same time, he learned that a new Abuna was on his way to Ethiopia, Abuna Salama III, who arrived in Ethiopia in the last months of 1841","With this success, the Dejazmach lost all discretion and he treated the envoys of Ras Ali with contempt, and announced that he would defeat Ras Ali, whom he claimed was still a Moslem at heart, and install Tekle Giyorgis, related to the Solomonic dynasty, on the Imperial throne in Gondar.\nOnce Abuna Salama arrived in Wube's camp the Dejazmach marched into Begemder, where with the help of Birru Goshu he captured Gondar, then the allies continued south against Ras Ali's army","The two forces met near Debre Tabor 7 February 1842; Ras Ali had summoned nearly 30,000 soldiers to support him, amongst whom were Wube's brother Dejazmach Merso and Ali's uncle Dejazmach Birru Aligaz","Mordechai Abir observes that this \"was clearly a battle between the Christian Amhara and Tigrean elements and the Galla [Oromo], fighting desperately to preserve their predominant position in northern\nEthiopia.\"Although the two forces were equal in numbers, Dejazmach Wube's superiority in firearms carried the day","Ras Ali escaped the battlefield with a number of his followers, and with possession of the battlefield the Dejazmach and his ally Birru Goshu settled down to a feast to celebrate their victory","At that moment they were surprised by a small detachment under Dejazmach Birru Aligaz, who captured Dejazmach Wube and chased Birru Goshu across the Abbay River into Gojjam","Released from his imprisonment, Ras Ali grudgingly rewarded his uncle with the governorship of Daunt, a district along the border of  Amhara and Wello; Dejazmach Merso was given Wube's territories in Tigray.\nDespite this victory, Ras Ali was in a worse position than before the battle","His enemies were still operating in Gojjam, Damot, Dembiya, and Lasta; the clergy was still hostile to him, and his own Christian subjects in Begemder and Amhara were even more disaffected","To secure the Abuna's help, he was forced to free Dejazmach Wube and go to war against his ally Dejazmach Merso to help Wube recover his territories","His Moslem allies in Welo, alarmed at the Christian Birru Aligaz being invested on their borders, likewise grew disaffected","Ras Ali was forced to seek help elsewhere, and sought it from the Egyptians, who at the moment were consolidating their hold on Sudan","Although in the short term a beneficial move, this only served to further erode his local support, leading to a vicious cycle leading to Ras Ali's eventual defeat by a competent rival—the future Emperor

Indians swarmed in, killing everyone they saw","The French soldiers looted what they could and set the powder magazines on fire","The fort was burned to the ground.\nThe establishment of Fort Oswego (modern Oswego, New York) in the 1720s on the south shores of Lake Ontario (called Lac de Frontenac by the French) represented the first British toehold in what until then had been a \"French lake\", and was regarded as a major threat by the French","The French had dominated the Great Lakes and with it the lucrative fur trade, and were determined to keep the Great Lakes for themselves","However, the 1720s-30s were a period of Anglo-French detente in Europe with both the duc d'Orleans, the Regent for the boy king Louis XV in France, and Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole in Britain, being committed to a policy of peace","Through the French protested at the establishment of Fort Oswego, saying the Great Lakes were part of New France, neither Paris nor London wanted a war over a fort in far-away North America, and so the matter rested for the moment","Versailles and Whitehall both agreed to an understanding that the British would not build any more forts on the Great Lakes in exchange for which the French tolerated Fort Oswego","Fort Oswego was a remote frontier post located in the wildness, and in the words of the Canadian historian René Chartrand its \"Achilles heel\" was its supply lines","The period of Anglo-French detente and peace which both Walpole and the duc d'Orleans pursued gave way to a period of war in the middle 18th century","France and Britain went to war in the inconclusive War of the Austrian Succession which was followed by the Seven Years' War, which began in North America in 1754 when the Virginia militia under the command of George Washington made a very unsuccessful attempt to expel the French from the Ohio river valley.\nFollowing the failure of aggressive British campaign plans in 1755, a chain of forts along the Mohawk River riverway connecting the Hudson River to Lake Ontario were garrisoned during the winter of 1755–1756","The largest garrison was left at Fort Oswego, at the end of the chain, which depended on the others for its supplies","Two forts along the Oneida Carry were a key element of this supply chain","The Oneida Carry traversed an unnavigable section between what is now Rome, New York and Wood Creek that was between one and six miles long, depending on seasonal water levels","Wood Creek in its turn flowed into Oneida Lake, which flowed into the Oswego river that ran into Lake Ontario","On the other side of the Oneida Carrying Place was the Mohawk river, which flowed into the Hudson river, which in its turn flowed into the Atlantic ocean","Fort Williams, on the Mohawk, was the larger of the two, while Fort Bull (modern Rome, New York), several miles north of Fort Williams on Wood Creek, was little more than a palisade surrounding storehouses","Fort Bull was garrisoned by a small number of men from Shirley's Regiment under William Bull, and held large quantities of military stores, including gunpowder and ammunition, destined for use in the 1756 campaign","Shirley's Regiment was a British Army regiment raised in New England with the majority of the soldiers coming from the colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island Plantation, and Connecticut.The assemblies of Pennsylvania and Virginia had only voted for enough money to defend their frontiers while the assemblies of the New England colonies had raised more men than what Shirley had requested after London had promised to pay off their debts if they would contribute to the war, so Shirley took the surplus men into the 50th Regiment, known as Shirley's regiment","The majority of the Shirely's regiment, who arrived in the Oneida Carry on 2 September 1755 were described by the American historian Gilbert Hagerty as \"raw\" and \"untrained\"","Following the battle of Lake George in September 1755, a British victory that had led to the deaths of many of the warriors from the Iroquois Six Nations who had been fighting on the British side, the Six Nations had pulled out of the war and declared their neutrality","Shirley had ambitious plans for the 1756 campaign to take Fort Duquense (modern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Fort Rouillé (modern Toronto, Ontario), Fort Saint-Frédéric (modern Crown Point, New York), Fort Niagara (modern Youngstown, New York), and Fort Frontenac (modern Kingston, Ontario) with the campaign to culminate with taking Quebec City","Since the New England colonies had voted more money and raised more men than did either Pennsylvania and Virginia, Shirley was focused on his plans for a campaign on the Great Lakes rather in the Ohio river valley.\n\nIn the fall of 1755, Onondaga Indian travelers passing through Montréal mentioned to the French that the British were building two warehouses at the Oneida Carrying Place","The Marquis de Vaudreuil, the Governor-General of New France, hired Ou8atory, an Oswegatchie chief related to several Oneida clan mothers, to work as a spy, and find out what was going on at the Oneida Carrying Place","The Iroquois were a matriarchal society where the clan mothers had enormous power, and no important decision was ever made by the Iroquois without the approval of the clan mothers first, an aspect of Iroquois society that the Europeans did not understand very well, who tended to assume the Iroquois chiefs had the same power that kings did in the patriarchal society of Europe","Ou8atory returned to report that the British had built two supply-houses at the Oneida Carry, where they were stockpiling weapons, ammunition, bateaux, and other supplies for a spring offensive.In early 1756 French military leaders in Canada decided to send a raiding expedition to attack Oswego's supply line","As the waters melted south of Lake Ontario an average of two weeks before the waters north of Lake Ontario did, the French feared the British would be able to launch an offensive in the spring to seize the main French forts, namely Fort Niagara  and Fort Frontenac before the French forces in Montréal could come to their relief","Vaudreuil chose to launch a preventive strike to destroy the British warehouses in the Oneida Carrying Place in the winter, and selected Lieutenant Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry of the  Troupes de la Marine to command the strike force","Vaudreuil admitted that a winter strike was dangerous, going on to write in a report to Paris \"...but the situation became urgent and I could not defer it without running the risk of being forestalled by the enemy at Niagara and at Fort Frontenac\".The Troupes de la Marine were under the control of the Ministry of the Marine, which ran the Royal French Navy and all of the French colonies, dressed in distinctive white and blue uniform, and were recruited in France for an 8-year period of service","Though the men of the Troupes de la Marine were recruited in France, many of the officers were Canadiens","From the 1690s on, the sons of the seigneurs of New France had often been attached to the Troupes de la Marine as cadets starting in their teenage years before securing a commission in the Troupes de la Marine, meaning that many of officers of the Troupes de la Marine were familiar with frontier warfare and knew the Indian languages","Chartrand wrote the Canadian-born officers of the Troupes de la Marine had \"...devised an unwritten tactical doctrine that combined the best elements of European organization and discipline with the American Indians' extraordinary ability to travel great distances largely undetected and mount very fierce attacks\"","In New France, all able-bodied men had to serve in the militia from the ages of 16 to 60 with every parish being organized into a company that practiced war games once very month","The French-Canadian militia wore no uniforms and received no pay, but received a gun, ammunition and other equipment from the French state when called up","As almost every Canadien man owned a gun and was a dead shot, having been using flintlocks from childhood onward and as many French-Canadians worked as voyageurs in the fur trade, they knew the frontier very well","Chartrand called the militia of New France \"fierce and outstanding bush fighters\".In the late 17th century, large numbers of Iroquois were converted to Roman Catholicism by French Jesuits, and as a result, many Catholic Iroquois chose to settle at Kanesatake and Kahnawake outside of Montréal, where they were intended by the French to serve as a buffer to protect Montréal, the center of the French fur trade","Historians call the Catholic Iroquois living outside of Montréal the Canadian Iroquois while the Iroquois who remained in Kanienkeh (\"the Land of the Flint\", the Iroquois name for their historical homeland in what is now upstate New York) are known as the League Iroquois","Today, the descendants of the Canadian Iroquois are called the Seven Nations of Canada","The Canadian Iroquois considered the French to be their allies, not their superiors, with the Onontio (the Iroquois term for the governor-general of New France) who represented the \"Great Onontio\" (the King of France) merely an especially important ally whose ways were somewhat strange and had to be constantly humored in order to obtain the European goods that the Iroquois valued so much","As the French did not know the part of Kanienkeh where the Oneida Carrying Place was located very well, they needed the assistance of the Canadian Iroquois to guide them there","Vaudreuil considered destroying the warehouses at the Oneida Carrying Place so important that though he did not want a war with the League Iroquois, he ordered Léry to attack the League Iroquois if any of them objected to the French being in Kanienkeh","From the French viewpoint, it was better to keep the League Iroquois neutral rather than having them fight on the side of British, which was especially the case as the League Iroquois and Canadian Iroquois had a notable reluctance to fight one another.The Canadian Iroquois chiefs and clan mothers were dubious about the French plans for a winter strike at the Oneida Carry, and Léry reported that one Mohawk chief, Missakin was only convinced on 25 February 1756 \"by the words that I [Léry] gave to him in the name of Monsieur de Vaudreuil...He joined me, along with his band\"","On 29 February 1756, Léry's force of Troupes de la Marine, French-Canadian militiamen and Canadian Iroquois war bands left Montréal","As they marched, Léry picked up more volunteers from the Iroquois communities, by promising them that they would not be assaulting forts and they would only fight against the British, not the League Iroquois","On 9 March 1756, Léry learned from an Akwesasne war band that the British had built two forts at the Oneida Carrying Place, information that he chose not to share with the Canadian Iroquois accompanying his expedition.\n\nOn March 12, a company of men left Fort de La Présentation and began an overland trek toward the Oneida Carry","Under the command of Lieutenant[Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry, a Canadian-born seigneur, the force consisted of 84 troupes de la Marine, 111 Canadian militiamen, and 110 natives, mostly Iroquois but also some Hurons","On 13 March 1756, an Oswegatchie traveler told the Canadian Iroquois about the British forts at the Oneida Carrying Place, which caused them to demand a halt","The Canadian historian D","Peter MacLeod called the arguments between the French and the Canadian Iroquois a cultural clash, writing\n\nFor French officers such as Léry, a military operation could still be a success if half their subordinates became casualties, providing that it had achieved a sufficiently important objective","This perspective was not necessarily shared by soldiers and militiamen for whom personal survival might take precedence over the achievement of abstract imperial goals","For Amerindians, on the other hand, no amount of prestige from a military operation was worth the loss of a single life","When Canadian Iroquois fighters went to war, they employed many of the strategies and tactics of the hunt","Successful hunters used stealth and cleverness to assure themselves of the maximum advantage and sought to kill an animal quietly and efficiently","Getting mauled by a bear, lost, shot by accident and harmed by any of the other dangers incidental to hunting would turn an otherwise successful hunt into a grim failure.\nAs the Canadian Iroquois population was much smaller than the French population, the purpose of war for them was to take prisoners without suffering losses in return, and as such assaulting a fort was out of the question for them","Furthermore, Léry as the product of the authoritarian French state expected his orders to be obeyed unconditionally while the Iroquois chiefs were merely first among equals, who had to seek a consensus from their warriors before acting.The Iroquois demanded that the planned attack on the forts be scrapped, and instead argued for raiding the British settlements along the Mohawk river valley","Léry stated as an officer of the  Troupes de la Marine he expected his orders to be obeyed without question, and upon seeing the Iroquois would not obey his orders and many were deserting, he told them there were no forts at the Oneida Carry, and that they would be \"delighted to find many Englishmen there; that the Onontio had sent me to fight them\"","Many of the Indians were not impressed, and went home","After nearly two weeks of difficult winter travel, they arrived near the carry on March 24."]},{"title":"Battle of

Hill","sentences":["The Battle of Gqokli Hill was conducted in about April 1818, a part of the Mfecane, between Shaka of the Zulu nation and Zwide of the Ndwandwe, in Shaka's territory just south of present-day Ulundi ( 28° 22' 23\" S 31° 21' 15.77\" E).\nThis was to be Shaka's first major battle against the dominant power in southeastern Africa (what would eventually become kwaZulu Natal), the Ndwandwe Paramountcy, led by nKosi (king) Zwide","The Ndwandwe king, who had assassinated the nKosi of the Mthethwa Paramountcy, Dingiswayo, the year before, was actively trying to absorb or exterminate the surviving members of that kingdom, including the then-small Zulu clan under their new chief, Shaka.\nIn spite of being significantly outnumbered, masterful strategy and tactics won the battle for Shaka","To delay the Ndwandwe invasion army, under command of Zwide's eldest son and heir, Nomahlanjana, Shaka posted forces along the drifts (fords) of the White Umfolozi River to delay the enemy while the river was still relatively high","Meanwhile, he laid waste to the area on the south (Zulu) side the river, and moved most of his clan's noncombatants and cattle into hiding in the Nkandla Forest, on the southern extremities of Zulu land","He then placed the bulk of his troops around the top of Gqokli hill, with a reserve and all his supplies out of sight in a depression at the top of the hill","To Nomahlanja, it seemed like a much smaller force of Zulus at the top of the hill and he anticipated it would be an easy massacre, \"Like butchering cattle in a kraal,\" he is reputed to have said.Before the Ndwandwe army was across the river and surrounding his hilltop position, Shaka dispatched about 700 from his small army, with a fraction of the clan's cattle herd, to make a display about ten kilometers south of Gqokli and tempt Nomahlanjana to split his force to capture them","The Ndwandwe general, thinking he was seeing the entire Zulu herd and half their army, obliged by sending four regiments (about 4,000 men) off to chase the cattle down.By about nine o'clock in the morning, once all eight of the remaining Ndwandwe regiments (about 8,000) were arrayed at the bottom of Gqokli Hill, Nomahlanjana gave the signal for the attack","In the first charge up the slopes, it quickly became apparent that the Ndwandwe superiority in numbers would actually be a hindrance, for the converging formations began to crowd into each other, making it difficult to throw their spears effectively","And when Shaka ordered a counter-attack, his men, who had no throwing spears (assegai) but were armed with the new, shorter, stabbing assegai (amaKlwa), charged downhill and routed the packed mob of Ndwandwes.\nNomahlanjana, who was no fool, saw that his overconfidence was premature","He correctly reasoned that the problem presented by the Zulu's central hilltop position, and the congestion that caused in his own forces, needed more thoughtful, flexible tactics","As many as five attacks were made during the day, each one trying a slightly different technique","But all failed to overwhelm the perceptibly small band of Zulus.\nThe Ndwandwe commander was also aware that his men, who had drunk all of their carried water, were becoming thirsty and exhausted in the hot, dry weather","They were starting to slip away in increasing numbers to make their way back to the nearest water, the Umfolozi river, about two kilometers from the battlefield","Shaka's men, by contrast and thanks to his foresight, had plenty of water, food and first aid supplies in the depression on top of the summit, so were not nearly so taxed by the weather.\nShaka had earlier arranged for the decoy force to the south to signal him with smoke when the 4,000 Ndwandwes on the cattle raiding expedition were heading back","Just after the fourth Ndwandwe attack had been repulsed, Shaka saw the smoke signal to the south","That meant he had very little time left to destroy Nomahlanjana's main army before it was reinforced.\nBoth sides had suffered casualties during the day, the Ndwandwes in greater proportion than the Zulus (due, it has been claimed by Zulu oral tradition, to the superior weapons, discipline, and fighting techniques implemented by Shaka)","But Nomahlanjana calculated, based on the thinning ranks of the four Zulu regiments he could see on the hill, that he still had a vastly superior force","He also concluded that the Zulus must be getting as hot, tired and thirsty as his own men (not aware of their ability to refresh themselves on the hilltop)","He decided to make one, last, decisive attack","He moved 1,500 of his warriors, including his crack amaNkayia brigade, to the north of the hill in a gigantic attack column, about twenty men wide and seventy-five ranks deep","There were only, from what he could see, about 500 Zulus left on this side of the hill","He would lead this charge in person and simply roll over the remnant of the Zulu force","He left the remainder of his regiments in an arc to the south of the hill as a pinning force to keep Shaka from reinforcing his threatened flank.\nBut Shaka could see very well what was coming and felt that the time was ripe for him to spring his trap","All day long he had been fighting off the Ndwandwe assaults with just four of his six regiments (the amaWombe, uDlambedlu, uKhangela, and Jubingwaqa), keeping his own elite brigade, consisting of the uFasimba and iziChwe regiments, out of sight and fresh in the hilltop depression","As the Ndwandwe shock column charged up the hill and into the waiting amaWombe regiment, Shaka launched his reserves in two encircling wings, completely enveloping the Ndwandwe column","These men had not expected such a large force to come out of nowhere","And they were thrown into a panic","This enveloping ploy on the part of Shaka was the first trial of a maneuver that would thereafter become the signature tactic of the Zulu army, the Impondo Zenkomo, or \"beast's horns\"","In several minutes, virtually all of the surprised and demoralized Ndwandwes in the column, including Nomahlanana and four of his brothers, were killed","They managed to take some Zulus with them, but the outcome was foregone.\nAs the fighting on the northern slope wound down, Shaka ordered his remaining regiment on the south side, the Jubingwaqa, to attack the southern wing of the Ndwandwes","These, hearing first rumour and then confirmation of the massacre of their comrades on the north, made a fighting retreat in the direction of the approaching 4,000 cattle raiders","When these latter came in sight, the Jubingqwanga broke off and, with the remnants of the regiment with the decoy (the Nkomendala), hung on the flanks of the retreating Ndwandwes to harass them and take back as many cattle as they could.\nMeanwhile, Shaka dispatched two of his regiments (probably the fresher uFasimba and iziCwe) to the north to mop up the Ndwandwe stragglers who had gone off in search of water at the river.\nThe battle was a bloody one, in which the Ndwandwes supposed lost as many as 7,500 men (including five of Zwide's oldest sons), or almost two-thirds of their original force","The Zulus, though, suffered about 2,000 casualties (most of them killed), or about 40%","In the Nguni tradition of war-of-annihilation, neither side took prisoners.While Shaka's new tactics, his newly trained army, and his shrewd battle plan saved his people from extermination, he had by no means eliminated the Ndwandwe threat","He had only eked out a respite","The Zulus had given up several hundred cattle (the economic capital of the Zulu economy) and sacrificed precious fighters they could not afford to lose","Zwide, for his part, was infuriated by the loss of his sons, by the blow to his arms, and, most of all by the temerity of the upstart usuper of the Zulu clan, and came back the following year with an even larger army and smarter generals","Shaka had just that year to build up his own power to meet the second invasion he knew was coming","This he was able to do by vigorous diplomacy with other tribes, and by attracting thousands of angry warriors with scores to settle with the Zwide.\n\n"]},{"title":"Battle of Grahamstown","sentences":["The Battle of Grahamstown took place on 22 April 1819, during the 5th Xhosa War, at the frontier settlement of

hundred wounded and confusion increased hourly","On the night of the third day (1 June) Grabbe saw that further advance was impossible and gave orders to retreat along the same road.\nThe retreat was worse than the advance","It necessitated the abandonment, or, where possible, the destruction of everything that would slow their movements","The retreat became vary disorganized and assumed the appearance of a rout {The sources do not say whether this was due to command failure or whether there was some other problem}","On 4 June (the sixth day) they arrived back in Gerzel, having lost 66 officers, 1700 men, one field gun and nearly all their provisions and stores.\nWhen Shamil heard of Grabbe’s movement he abandoned his perhaps unprofitable campaign and hurried back to Chechnya","When he arrived the fighting was already over","The impact of Grabbe's failure was even greater because he had faced only the local levies of two Naibs – Shu ‘ayb and Ullubey"," A month later Grabbe made an unsuccessful raid against Igali on the Andi Koysu","After this he was released from command at his own request","Grabbe's return was witnessed by Prince Chernyshev, the Minister of War","This

German policy of avoiding all fleet-to-fleet contact","At the end of 1916, after further unsuccessful attempts to reduce the Royal Navy's numerical advantage, the German Navy accepted that its surface ships had been successfully contained, subsequently turning its efforts and resources to unrestricted submarine warfare and the destruction of Allied and neutral shipping, which—along with the

one in the distant village of Safi—codenamed Operation Inferno (Hebrew: מבצע תופת‎) and Operation Asuta (מבצע אסותא), respectively—but the former turned into a full-scale battle.After Jordan lost control of the West Bank to Israel in 1967, Palestinian fighters known as fedayeen moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli-occupied territories, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters","The IDF claimed that the purpose was to destroy the fedayeen camps at Karameh, and to capture Yasser Arafat, the leader of the PLO as reprisal","Israel also wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to the fedayeen.A large Israeli force launched an attack on the town on the dawn of 21 March, supported by fighter jets","Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire, while the Palestinian irregulars engaged in guerrilla warfare","The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner","The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters","The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.Both sides declared victory","On a tactical level, the battle went in Israel's favor, as the aim of destroying the Karameh camp was achieved","On the other hand, Arafat was not captured, and the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis","They failed to retrieve three dead soldiers that were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanian Army.The battle gained wide acclaim and recognition in the Arab world, and the following period witnessed an upsurge of support from Arab countries to the fedayeen in Jordan","The Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, but King Hussein allowed them to take credit","After the battle, Hussein proclaimed, \"I think we may reach a position where we are all fedayeen\"","However, as the PLO's strength began to grow in the aftermath, the fedayeen began to speak openly of overthrowing the Hashemite monarchy, and the ensuing tensions with the Jordanian authorities eventually precipitated in their expulsion to Lebanon during the events of Black September in 1970.\n\n"]},{"title":"Battle of Karavia Bay","sentences":["The Battle of Karavia Bay occurred in February 1944 and was the first surface engagement fought in the Rabaul area of New Britain during the
