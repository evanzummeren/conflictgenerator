Washington Agreement of March 1994, brokered by the United States to end the Croat–Bosniak War fought between the ARBiH and the HVO in Bosnia and Herzegovina","The ARBiH and the HVO were not coordinated at first, rather they launched separate operations aimed at capture of Kupres.\nThe ARBiH offensive, codenamed Autumn-94 (Jesen-94), started on 20 October, with the primary aim of advancing from Bugojno towards VRS-held Donji Vakuf, supported by a secondary attack towards Kupres aimed at disruption of the VRS defences and threatening a supply route to Donji Vakuf","The primary attacking force soon ground to a halt, shifting the focus of the operation to Kupres, where substantial reinforcements were deployed to ensure a gradual advance of the ARBiH","On 29 October, the HVO decided to attack, as it considered the ARBiH had directly threatened the strategic Kupres plateau","The HVO launched its offensive, codenamed Operation Cincar (Operacija Cincar), on 1 November","Following a brief lull in the ARBiH advance, thought to be brought on by a variety of causes and a direct request by the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović to the ARBiH

by the Russian forces.In accounting the Russians for the defeat of an army nearly 40,000 Ottoman forces of all arms by a hostile force of less than one-half that number, it is not sufficient to say

German strength and improve his prestige with his allies, who he thought were considering withdrawing from the war","It was also hoped that large numbers of Soviet prisoners would be captured to be used as slave labour in the German armaments industry","The Soviet government had foreknowledge of the German intentions, provided in part by British intelligence's Tunny intercepts","Aware months in advance that the attack would fall on the neck of the Kursk salient, the Soviets built a defence in depth designed to wear down the German armoured spearhead","The Germans delayed the offensive while they tried to build up their forces and waited for new weapons, giving the Red Army time to construct a series of deep defensive belts and establish a large reserve force for counter-offensives.The battle was the final strategic offensive that the Germans were able to launch on the Eastern Front","Because the Allied invasion of Sicily began during the battle, Adolf Hitler was forced to have troops training in France diverted to meet the Allied threat in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front","Hitler canceled the offensive at Kursk after only a week, in part to divert forces to Italy","Germany's extensive losses of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war","The Battle of Kursk was the first time in the Second World War that a German strategic offensive was halted before it could break through enemy defences and penetrate to its strategic depths","Though the Red Army had succeeded in winter offensives previously, their counter-offensives after the German attack at Kursk were their first successful summer offensives of the war."]},{"title":"Battle of
