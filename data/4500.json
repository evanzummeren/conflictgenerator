Aviazione Legionaria, under the code name 'Operation Rügen'","The operation opened the way to Franco's capture of Bilbao and his victory in northern Spain.\nThe attack gained controversy because it involved the bombing of civilians by a military air force","Seen as a war crime by some historians,  and argued as a legitimate attack by others, it was one of the first aerial bombings to capture global attention","The number of victims is still disputed; the Basque government reported 1,654 people killed at the time, while local historians identified 126 victims (later revised by the authors

Kassa","sentences":["The bombing of Kassa took place on 26 June 1941, when still unidentified aircraft conducted an airstrike on the city of Kassa, then a part of Hungary, today Košice in Slovakia","This attack became the pretext for the government of Hungary to declare war on the Soviet Union the next day, 27 June.\nOn 26 June 1941, four days after Germany attacked the Soviet Union in violation of the Molotov–Ribbentrop non-aggression treaty as a part of Operation Barbarossa, three unidentified planes bombed the city, killing and wounding over a dozen people and causing minor material damage","Numerous buildings were hit, including the local post and telegraph office.Hours after the attack, the Hungarian cabinet \"passed a resolution calling for the declaration of the existence of a state of war between Hungary and the USSR.\" The local military investigators at the time believed that the attackers were Soviet, but the true identity of the attacking nation has never been established","The official explanation preferred by Soviet historians was the idea of a feigned attack by Germany to provoke Hungary into attacking the Soviet Union, employing Soviet planes captured on conquered airfields","Another possibility is that the Soviet bombers mistook Kassa for a nearby city in the First Slovak Republic, which was already at war with the Soviet Union","Captain Ádám Krúdy, the commander of the Kassa military airfield, identified the attackers as German Heinkel He 111 bombers in his official report but was ordered to keep silent about it","Another problem with the German conspiracy theory was the fact that German planes did not have bomb-racks capable of holding Soviet bombs","According to Dreisziger, \"it seems that the bombs dropped on Kassa were 100 kg bombs while the standard stock of the Luftwaffe were the 50 and 250 kg bombs.\" During the Nuremberg trials, the USSR brought forth a statement allegedly taken from Hungarian Major General István Újszászy","According to the testimony, \"the Kassa 'plot' was hatched by German and Hungarian officers and carried out by 'German planes with Russian markings'.\" This theory was introduced because he found that, following the Kassa bombings, certain officers behaved suspiciously, not due to concrete evidence","The reliability of his testimony less valued due to the nature of his interrogation, which may have been under duress.In his memoirs, Admiral Miklós Horthy, Hungary's head of state in the interwar period, stated that Hungary's entry into World War II had been provoked by the \"staged\" bombing of Kassa carried out by German pilots","He also accused General Henrik Werth, the Hungarian Chief of Staff of being a part of the conspiracy.In 1942, a report was made that a Hungarian officer, billeted in a house in a town of occupied Soviet Union, learned that an earlier occupant of his room had been one Andrej Andele, a Czech-born pilot of the Soviet Air Force, who had openly admitted his part in the raid on Kassa","This theory was shut down as well, due to the fact that the aircraft that bombed Kassa were twin-engined monoplanes","The Soviet Air Force did not have this kind of aircraft, but had biplanes","With this knowledge, the type of craft used in this attack could only be taken from the Germans","Another factor that breaks down this theory was the timing of the attacks","The westernmost town Kassa was reportedly attacked around shortly after 1 P.M","According to evidence brought by the Soviets at Nuremberg, the easternmost town was raided around 12:30 P.M","This evidence proved that the attack came from the east, from Soviet Union, rather than Slovakia from the west.According to modern historians Iván Pataki, László Rozsos and Gyula Sárhidai, Soviet aircraft attacked the city by mistake while targeting a German radio station in the city of Prešov (Eperjes), Slovakia, about 30 kilometres north of Kassa","All three bombers aimed at the post office building which had a large radio antenna on its roof","After releasing a total of 29 bombs, one of the planes dropped a single bomb outside the city which did not explode; it was recovered and identified as a 105 kg Soviet bomb","According to this explanation, Krúdy misidentified three Soviet TB-3 bombers as German He 111s, but the suggestion that this identification was \"hushed up\" represented post-war Communist propaganda."]},{"title":"Bombing of Katyr-Yurt","sentences":["The reported bombing of Katyr-Yurt (Chechnya) occurred on February 4, 2000, when Russian forces bombed the

British out of Ireland","The French anticipated that this would be a major blow to British morale, prestige and military effectiveness, and was also intended to possibly be the first stage of an

their army fell back, the Russians employed scorched-earth tactics, destroying villages, towns and crops and forcing the invaders to rely on a supply system that was incapable of feeding their large army in the field","On 7 September, the French caught up with the Russian Army, which had dug itself in on hillsides before the small town of Borodino, seventy miles (110 km) west of Moscow","The following Battle of Borodino, the bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, with 72,000 casualties, resulted in a narrow French victory","The Russian Army withdrew the following day, leaving the French again without the decisive victory Napoleon sought","A week later, Napoleon entered Moscow, only to find it abandoned, and the city was soon ablaze, with the French blaming the fire on Russian arsonists.\nThe capture of Moscow did not compel Alexander I to sue for peace, and Napoleon stayed in Moscow for a month, waiting for a peace offer that never came","On 19 October 1812,

invasion","The defending Algerian forces were led by Baba Mohammed ben-Osman","The assault was ordered by the King of Spain, Charles III, who was attempting to demonstrate to the Barbary States the power of the revitalized Spanish military after the disastrous Spanish experience in the Seven Years' War","The assault was also meant to demonstrate that Spain would defend its Moroccan enclaves against any Ottoman encroachment, and reduce the influence that the Barbary states held in the Mediterranean.\nThe Spanish forces departed from Cartagena in 1775 and sailed towards Algiers","On the coast, near the city, O'Reilly ordered the Spanish forces to land on the shores and capture the city, while the Spanish and Tuscan warships would protect the landing craft as they landed on the shore","However, the landing was flawed from the start, as the area chosen by the Spanish for the landing was not the one the pilots of the landing craft sailed towards, with the new landing site being totally unsuitable for bringing ashore the heavy artillery that was going to be used to bombard the city walls of Algiers, with most of the guns becoming stuck in the wet sand resulting in their absence from the ensuing fight","Despite this, the Spanish forces assaulted Algerian forces, who proceeded to draw back to positions further inland","The Spanish chose to pursue, but walked into a carefully set trap and suffered massive casualties, losing a quarter of their total force compared with light casualties on the Algerian side","Forced to retreat back to their boats waiting offshore, the assault ended in a spectacular failure and the campaign proved to be a humiliating blow to the Spanish military reorganisation.\nThe armed forces of Spain had recently undergone a massive revival project under the personal command of the King of Spain, Charles III","This came after the humiliating Spanish defeat in the Seven Years' War, where Charles had declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain in support of his traditional Bourbon allies, the Kingdom of France, in 1762","However, Havana and Manila, the capital of the Spanish colonial empire in the Americas and Asia, were both

future wars","Spain at the time held several exclaves on the coast of Morocco, although these were constantly under threat of Moroccan encroachment","Charles was determined to not lose any more territory after losing Florida and Menorca to the British, a similar rationale for the French conquest of Corsica","\nAfter Spanish forces had successfully broken the Moroccan siege on the Spanish-held city in 1774, the government of Charles III of Spain decided to send a naval expedition to the North African coast, as he was determined to demonstrate to Sultan Mohammed III that Spain would not waver in its resolve to hold onto its Moroccan enclaves","The Spanish objective was to occupy Algiers; a key and supposedly vulnerable port, and a beating heart of Ottoman Algeria","The expedition was commanded by Alexander O'Reilly, an Irish officer who at a young age had entered Spanish military service, being a member of the Irish military diaspora","O'Reilly had long had a distinguished career in service of Spain","As head of the royal household guard in 1765, he had personally protected Charles III from an attempt on his life","In the aftermath of the Seven Years' War,

Ghaisne, comte de Bourmont","The French quickly defeated the troops of Hussein Dey, the Ottoman ruler, but native resistance was widespread"," This resulted in a protracted military campaign, lasting more than 45 years, to root out popular opposition to the colonisation"," The so-called \"pacification\" was marked by resistance of figures such as Ahmed Bey, Abd El-Kader and Lalla Fatma

principal towns in Northern Corsica; San Fiorenzo, Bastia and Calvi, which were in turn surrounded, besieged and bombarded until by August 1794 French forces had been driven from the island entirely.\nCorsica is a large island in the Ligurian Sea; naval forces stationed on the island have ability to exercise control over the waters off the coast of Southern France and Northwestern Italy","This was a principal theatre of the early French Revolutionary Wars, and the British commander in the region, Lord Hood, viewed control of Corsica as a vital component of his blockade of the French fleet based at Toulon","Corsica had been annexed by France in 1768, and the population had been resentful and rebellious ever since","The fervour of the French Revolution in 1789 had stirred their ambitions for independence, and their leader Pasquale Paoli appealed to Hood for support","Hood was initially distracted by the Siege of Toulon, but in early 1794 turned his attention to Corsica.\nCombining naval bombardments with amphibious landings of British soldiers and marines, and supported by Corsican irregulars, the British forces attacked the defences of San Fiorenzo, forcing the French to abandon the town and retreat to Bastia","Hood then led a force around the island and laid siege to the town, which surrendered after 37 days of blockade","This victory was sufficient for the Corsican people, through Paoli, to pledge allegiance to Britain","British reinforcements then laid siege to the last French-held fortress on the island, at Calvi, which was bombarded for two months, finally surrendering in August 1794.\nCorsica proved a mixed asset for the British; the island's anchorages provided some relief for a fleet operating at the end of a long supply chain, but the instability of Corsican politics and repeated French efforts to disrupt British control consumed valuable resources","By late 1796, with the French victorious in Northern Italy and the Spanish
